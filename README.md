This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Blogger Viewer

This project demonstrates how to fetch posts and comments from the Blogger API
and store them in a local SQLite database. Posts can be listed, created and
deleted through the UI under `/posts`. Comments for each post are also fetched
and displayed.

Create an `.env.local` file using `.env.example` and set your `BLOGGER_API_KEY`
and `BLOGGER_BLOG_ID` to import posts and comments from Blogger.

To retrieve all posts from the very beginning, send a request to
`/api/posts?refresh=1&fetchAll=1`. The server will paginate through the Blogger
API with small delays between requests to minimize load.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
